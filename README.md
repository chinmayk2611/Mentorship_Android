• Worked on a project that transitioned my college’s existing pen-and-paper-based mentorship system to a digital Android
application, improving productivity and data management.
• Technologies and Tools used: Android Studio, Flutter, Java, Firebase.
• Developed mentor, mentee, and admin modules with matching and feedback features to support academic growth.
